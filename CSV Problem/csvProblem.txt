Theoretical Challenge
Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

Q. I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with
the results. If it is a value, then return a value.  
If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.

Answer:-
First read the csv file using Scanner class then split the input data using useDelimiter()
then Create a data structure like map to store the values and formulas in memory. 
We can use a 2-dimensional array or a map to store the values and formulas.
Loop through the data structure and evaluate each formula. 
If a cell contains a formula, we can parse the formula and If the cell contains a value,
we can simply add it to the output.


How will you tackle the challenge above? What type of errors you would you check for?
How might a user break your code?
Answer:-
Parsing errors may occur If the input file is malformed, we need to handle 
parsing errors and provide informative error messages to the user.

Formula or Syntax references error: If a formula refers to itself or to a cell that refers back to it,
 we need to detect this and handle it appropriately. Or if the given cell in the formula is already empty we may get errors.

File format error and also file not found error may occurs. 

Formula syntax errors: If a formula contains syntax errors,
we need to detect these and provide informative error messages to the user.

Division by zero errors: Our formulas may contains divisor values and we need to handle this exceptions.


Write the results to a CSV output file

Answer:-

   A   B  C 
1  5   3  10

2  7   8  15

3  9   9  24
